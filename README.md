APE - Academic Planning Environment<br />

<p>I developed an academic planning environment that fetches data from a relational database, manipulates the received data into usable objects, and builds the webpage based on the objects. Once built, the courses can be completely reconfigured using drag n drop. My user interface won the people's choice award for best design.</p>

HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, JSON, jBuilder, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL
